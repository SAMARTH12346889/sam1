                    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
                    <p>Section 58 has been repealed and is no longer in effect under the IPC. It was originally part of the code but has since been removed.

                    <p><strong>Why It Is Imposed?</strong></p>
                    <p>This section was historically imposed to address certain legal processes under the British colonial rule. However, it was considered outdated and unnecessary in the post-independence legal framework, leading to its repeal.

                    <p><strong>Punishment and Penalty</strong></p>
                    <p>Since the section is repealed, there are no punishments or penalties associated with it.

                        <p>As the section is no longer in effect, there are no consequences or legal implications for violating it. It is no longer part of the IPC.

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>
                    <p>Section 60 of the IPC grants courts the discretion to impose a sentence that may be partly rigorous (involving hard labor) and partly simple imprisonment (without hard labor). This allows for a combination of punishment types depending on the circumstances of the offense.

                    </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why it is impose?</strong></p>
                    <p>It is imposed to provide flexibility in sentencing. It allows the court to tailor the punishment to the nature of the offense and the conduct of the offender. The judge may decide to impose a mixed sentence based on the severity of the crime and the likelihood of rehabilitation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Punishment and Penalty</strong></p>
                    <p>The punishment is imprisonment, with the possibility of being a combination of both rigorous (hard labor) and simple imprisonment, as decided by the court.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What If We Break the Law</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the individual violates the terms of imprisonment, such as escaping or disobeying prison rules, additional penalties may apply. This could include an extension of the sentence or an increase in the severity of the punishment. However, the punishment is decided based on the relevant section of the IPC under which the offense falls.
